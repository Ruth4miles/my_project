            I like participating in volunteer activities especially teaching underprivileged kids. 
            I have been associated with a few non-profit organisations since my college days and I like spending 
            my weekends helping these NGOs for different activities from teaching to organising interesting games 
            and activities to make learning fun for kids. I also love are reading books and working out. Along with 
            this, I also like cooking. While researching the company, I got to know about the in-house gym. 
            Having a gym in the workplace is a great idea as employees can get to know each other better on a 
            casual level apart from their designated roles.
